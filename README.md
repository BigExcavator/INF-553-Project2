Implementation of SON algorithm
Given a set of baskets, SON algorithm divides them into chunks/partitions and then proceed in two stages. First, local frequent itemsets are collected, which form candidates; next, it makes second pass through data to determine which candidates are globally frequent.  
The project implements all of the above operations
